							<h2>GFNGames.TK</h2>
						</header>
						<p>After the launch of Nvidia GeForce Now, I've searched for a way to display the list of games in a way that anyone can understand, because there were some companies that started to retires their games and I didn't want to buy a game to not be able to play it</p>
						<p>I've met Josh Pavey in the Discord of <a href="https://discord.gg/mrhrYSR">Stryde Gaming</a> who has coded the first version of the app called <a href="http://gfnlist.com">gfnlist.com</a></p>
						<p>Some days after they have launched the official GFN Discord based on the GFN Reddit, I guess, but I've seen that GFNList was dead and hopefully we have made a clone</p>
						<p>Some dayes after, we have taken the free domain name GFNGames.TK and had fun doing that, and in the community I have been asked to redirrect the site in a place where the app stays alive instead of redirrecting it to the Glitch.ME deployment that was used when Josh's app went down</p>
						<p>Now the app is deployed on one of my Virtual Private Servers and we've started to monitor it with Google Analytics</p>
						<p>I still keep the original name and the app is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/gfnlist">https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/gfnlist</a></p>
						<p>We want a minimal version that just helps viewing the games and we don't want a more complicated app or you can play with a more elaborated app <a href="https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/geforcenow-app">https://github.com/nazimboudeffa/geforcenow-app</a></p>
						<p>To be continued ...</p>
